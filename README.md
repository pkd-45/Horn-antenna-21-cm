# Horn-antenna-21-cm
This website will help you designing a horn antenna to detect the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen. There are four major parts to this repo. First section will help you know about the neutral 21 cm hydrogen line. Second has information about calculation of the dimensions of a horn antenna to detect the 21 cm Neutral Hydrogen line. This will also talk about assigning other hardware components. Third will help you install required softwares to analyze data received from the antenna. In the final section you will get to know about few theoratical concepts and plot the milky way rotation curve using the data received from the telescope. It is developed and maintained by Pratyush KUmar Das as a part of Master's degree thesis at National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, India.
